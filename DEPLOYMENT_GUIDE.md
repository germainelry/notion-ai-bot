# üöÄ Cloud Deployment Guide (Railway & Render)

## Railway Deployment (Recommended)

### 1. Prepare Your Code

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Notion AI Bot"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway

- Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- Sign up with GitHub
- Click **New Project** ‚Üí **Deploy from GitHub repo** ‚Üí Select your repository

### 3. Set Up the Web Service

- **Start Command:** `python app.py`
- **Port:** `8000`
- **Add Environment Variables:**
  ```
  NOTION_DB_ID=your_database_id_here
  NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_api_key_here
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
  ```
  _(Add any optional variables for FAST_MODE or custom delays as needed)_
- **Deploy the web service.**

### 4. Add the Worker Service (for Notion Processing)

- In your Railway project, click **New Service** (or the ‚Äú+‚Äù button)
- **Deploy from GitHub repo** ‚Üí Select your repository
- **Start Command:** `python main.py`
- **Add the same environment variables** as your web service
- **Deploy the worker service**

**You should now have two services:**

- `web` (runs `python app.py`) ‚Äî the dashboard/status page
- `worker` (runs `python main.py`) ‚Äî the background Notion processor

**Both must be running for full functionality!**

---

## Memory System (SQLite-based)

- All prompts and responses are now stored in a local SQLite database: `notion_bot_memory.db`.
- The bot uses this database to remember previous prompts and responses, providing context for new prompts automatically.
- **No manual setup is required for memory.** The database is created and updated by the worker service.
- To reset memory (start a new chat), run:
  ```sh
  python main.py reset
  ```
  (You can do this via the Railway shell or a one-off job.)
- **Persistence Note:** On Railway, the database file is stored in the service's filesystem. If the service is redeployed or restarted, the file may be lost unless you use persistent volumes (if available). For most users, memory will persist as long as the service is running.

## Render Deployment (Alternative)

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Create account with GitHub
3. New Web Service ‚Üí Connect your repo
4. **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. **Start Command:** `python app.py`
6. Add environment variables (same as above)
7. Deploy!

---

## Environment Variables

- **No secrets or API keys are in this repo.**
- **.env is gitignored and must be created by you.**
- **Safe for public GitHub.**

---

## Testing & Monitoring

- Add a test prompt to your Notion database (Status: Pending)
- Wait for the worker to process it
- Check the response and "Generated Date" in Notion
- Monitor logs in Railway/Render dashboard

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot not responding?**
  - Check logs in cloud platform
  - Verify environment variables
  - Test API keys locally
- **High costs?**
  - Monitor OpenAI usage
  - Set spending limits in OpenAI dashboard
  - Reduce polling frequency if needed
- **Memory not persisting?**
  - On Railway, the SQLite database (`notion_bot_memory.db`) is stored in the service's filesystem. If you redeploy or restart the service, memory may be lost unless persistent volumes are used.
  - To reset memory, use `python main.py reset`.

## Cost

- **Railway/Render:** FREE (500 hours/month)
- **OpenAI:** ~$2-5/month for personal use
- **Notion:** FREE

## Next Steps

1. Choose Railway or Render
2. Follow the deployment steps above
3. Add your environment variables
4. Deploy and test
5. Monitor the logs
6. Enjoy 24x7 automation!
