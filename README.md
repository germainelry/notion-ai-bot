# Notion AI Bot - Async Automation with ChatGPT & Notion ðŸš€

A modern, async automation system that seamlessly connects Notion to OpenAI's ChatGPT, designed to boost productivity by automating knowledge work, answering questions, and streamlining your workflow â€” all within your Notion workspace.

This lightweight Python bot continuously monitors a Notion database for new prompts (Status = Pending), sends them to ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 or GPT-4), and writes the generated responses directly back into the Notion table â€” making it your personal AI assistant for study notes, coding help, or content drafting.

## What Are the Two Services?

### 1. **Web Service (`app.py`)**

- **Purpose:** Runs the web dashboard/status page so you can monitor the bot's health and status in your browser.
- **How to run:** `python app.py`
- **Deploy as:** The `web` service on Railway/Render.

### 2. **Worker Service (`main.py`)**

- **Purpose:** Continuously polls your Notion database for new prompts, sends them to ChatGPT, and writes responses back to Notion.
- **How to run:** `python main.py`
- **Deploy as:** The `worker` service on Railway/Render.

**Both must be running for the bot to work!**

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **Automate Q&A, research, and documentation in Notion**
- **Async & Fast Mode**: Instant response with FAST_MODE, or tune delays for batching
- **Continuous Polling**: Adaptive intervals (configurable)
- **Web Interface**: Monitor status via browser (`app.py`)
- **Code Extraction**: Automatically extracts and stores code blocks separately
- **Memory System**: Tracks all prompts and responses for search and analysis
- **Long Response Handling**: Smart splitting for responses over 1900 characters

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo & set up your environment**
2. **Create a Notion database** with the required columns
3. **Configure your `.env` file** with Notion and OpenAI API keys
4. **Deploy both services** (web and worker) as described below

---

## Deployment (Railway Example)

1. **Deploy the Web Service**
   - Start command: `python app.py`
   - Add environment variables: `NOTION_DB_ID`, `NOTION_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.
2. **Deploy the Worker Service**
   - Start command: `python main.py`
   - Add the same environment variables as the web service

**Both services must be running for full functionality!**

## Environment Variables

- `NOTION_DB_ID`
- `NOTION_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- _(Optional: FAST_MODE, polling intervals, etc.)_

---

## Usage

- Add prompts to Notion (Status: Pending)
- The worker service processes them and updates the database
- Monitor the system via the web dashboard

---

## Troubleshooting

- Check logs in Railway/Render dashboard
- Ensure both services are running and have the correct environment variables
