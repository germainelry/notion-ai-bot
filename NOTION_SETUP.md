## Benefits of This Setup

âœ… **Async & Fast Mode**: Bot is fully async and can be set to instant response
âœ… **Configurable Delays**: All delays and intervals are configurable via env vars
âœ… **Clean Responses**: No timestamp clutter in the response text
âœ… **Sortable**: You can sort by generation date
âœ… **Filterable**: Filter by date ranges
âœ… **Professional**: Clean, organized appearance
âœ… **Searchable**: Easy to find responses by date

## Testing the Setup

1. Add a new row with a prompt
2. Set status to "Pending"
3. Run your bot: `python main.py` or deploy to Railway
4. Check that "Generated Date" is filled with date and time
5. Verify the response is clean (no timestamp prefix)

## Required Notion Integration Permissions

For the bot to work properly, your Notion integration needs these permissions:

### 1. **Database Access**

- **Read content**: To read prompts from the database
- **Update content**: To update responses and status

### 2. **Page Access** (for comment blocks feature)

- **Read content**: To read page content
- **Update content**: To add comment blocks for long responses
- **Insert content**: To add new blocks as comments

### How to Set Permissions:

1. Go to [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Select your integration
3. Under "Capabilities", ensure these are enabled:
   - âœ… **Read content**
   - âœ… **Update content**
   - âœ… **Insert content**

### Note on Comments Feature:

The "additional blocks as comments" feature requires **Insert content** permission. If you don't have this permission:

- Long responses will still be split into multiple parts
- But only the first part will be saved to the Response field
- Additional parts will be logged but not saved to Notion

## Security & Public Repo Notes

- **No secrets or API keys are in this repo.**
- **.env is gitignored and must be created by you.**
- **Safe for public GitHub.**

## Troubleshooting

**"Property not found" error:**

- Make sure column names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check that the column types are correct

**Date not showing:**

- Ensure the "Generated Date" column is set to Date type
- Check that your Notion integration has edit permissions
